# ND0003: Avoid string-based runtime activation

## Summary

`ND0003` warns when code uses string-based `Activator.CreateInstance(...)` overloads.

## Why this matters

- String-based activation depends on runtime type/assembly resolution.
- Trimming and NativeAOT can remove or rewrite metadata paths these calls depend on.
- This pattern can fail in published/AOT environments even if it works in local debug runs.

## Trigger example

```csharp
var instance = Activator.CreateInstance(assemblyName, typeName);
```

## Recommended fixes

Prefer one of these patterns:

- Use compile-time known types:

```csharp
var instance = Activator.CreateInstance(typeof(MyType));
```

- Use explicit factories or DI registrations for known concrete types.
- Avoid name-based activation paths for production AOT/trimming scenarios.

## Diagnostic details

- **ID**: `ND0003`
- **Category**: `NativeData.Compatibility`
- **Default severity**: `Warning`
- **Message**: `String-based activation with Activator.CreateInstance is not AOT/trimming-safe`

## Suppression guidance

Suppress only when runtime activation is required and deployment/runtime behavior is explicitly validated.
