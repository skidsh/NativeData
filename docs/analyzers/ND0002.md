# ND0002: Avoid runtime assembly loading

## Summary

`ND0002` warns when code uses `System.Reflection.Assembly.Load(string)`.

## Why this matters

- `Assembly.Load(string)` depends on runtime assembly name resolution.
- Trimming and NativeAOT reduce support for dynamic runtime loading patterns.
- Name-based loading can fail in published/AOT environments where assemblies are linked differently.

## Trigger example

```csharp
var assembly = Assembly.Load(assemblyName);
```

## Recommended fixes

Prefer one of these patterns:

- Use compile-time references to required types/assemblies.
- Pass known `Type` instances (for example via `typeof(...)`) and avoid name-based assembly loading.
- Register plugin types explicitly at compile time instead of dynamic assembly probing.

## Diagnostic details

- **ID**: `ND0002`
- **Category**: `NativeData.Compatibility`
- **Default severity**: `Warning`
- **Message**: `Runtime assembly loading with Assembly.Load(string) is not AOT/trimming-safe`

## Suppression guidance

Suppress only when runtime assembly loading is required and deployment/runtime constraints are explicitly validated.
