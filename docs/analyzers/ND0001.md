# ND0001: Avoid runtime type loading

## Summary

`ND0001` warns when code uses `System.Type.GetType(...)`, which is often fragile under trimming and NativeAOT.

## Why this matters

- `Type.GetType(string)` relies on runtime name-based type loading.
- Trimming can remove unreferenced types, causing runtime failures.
- NativeAOT favors compile-time type closure and explicit references.

## Trigger example

```csharp
var type = Type.GetType(typeName);
```

## Recommended fixes

Prefer one of these patterns:

- Use compile-time known types:

```csharp
var type = typeof(MyType);
```

- Use explicit generic registration/factory APIs that keep types rooted.
- Pass `Type` values directly instead of names when possible.

## Diagnostic details

- **ID**: `ND0001`
- **Category**: `NativeData.Compatibility`
- **Default severity**: `Warning`
- **Message**: `Runtime type loading with Type.GetType is not AOT/trimming-safe`

## Suppression guidance

Suppress only when runtime loading is intentional and validated for deployment targets.
