# ND1001: NativeData entity key column must map to a public property

## Summary

`ND1001` warns when `[NativeDataEntity(..., keyColumn)]` specifies a key column that does not match any public readable property on the entity type.

## Why this matters

- NativeData mapping relies on a resolvable key member for repository operations.
- A key-column/property mismatch causes generated mapping to fail or behave unexpectedly.
- Catching this at analysis time prevents runtime and generation-time surprises.

## Trigger example

```csharp
[NativeDataEntity("Widgets", "WidgetId")]
public sealed class Widget
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
}
```

## Recommended fixes

Use one of the following:

- Rename/add a public property that matches the declared key column.
- Update the `keyColumn` argument to match the actual key property name.
- Use the default key column (`Id`) when appropriate.

## Diagnostic details

- **ID**: `ND1001`
- **Category**: `NativeData.Mapping`
- **Default severity**: `Warning`
- **Message**: `Entity '{type}' is marked with [NativeDataEntity] key column '{key}', but no matching public readable property was found`

## Suppression guidance

Suppress only when key mapping is intentionally handled outside standard NativeData entity conventions.
